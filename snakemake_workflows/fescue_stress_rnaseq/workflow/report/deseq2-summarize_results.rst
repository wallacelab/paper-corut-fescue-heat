Summary tables of significant DESeq2 differential expression analysis results. The first column is the gene identifier. The second column is the base mean expression value. The third column is the log2 fold change. The fourth column is the standard error of the log2 fold change. The fifth column is the Wald statistic. The sixth column is the p-value. The seventh column is the adjusted p-value. The eighth column is the log2 fold change with shrinkage. The ninth column is the standard error of the log2 fold change with shrinkage. The tenth column is the adjusted p-value using independent hypothesis weighting. The eleventh column is the weight used in the independent hypothesis weighting. The twelfth column is the TAIR identifier. The thirteenth column is the top blastx Arabidopsis thaliana hit. The fourteenth column is the Gene Ontology biological process description. The fifteenth column is the Gene Ontology molecular function description. The sixteenth column is the transcription factor assignment. The seventeenth column is the transcription factor family assignment. The eighteenth column is the accession number of the best blastx hit to Brachypodium distachyon. The nineteenth column is the accession number of the best blastx hit to Sorghum bicolor. The twentieth column is the locus identifier of the best blastx hit to Oryza sativa. The tables are tab-delimited.
